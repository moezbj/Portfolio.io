In this mini-project I have developed a  web application with bootstrap , as part of my full stack JavaScript training offered by [GOMYCODE Tunisia](https://www.gomycode.tn)
## Project brief
This is a small web application wich does the following:

<strong>User Story</strong> I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.

<strong>User Story</strong>  I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages

<strong>User Story</strong> I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)

<strong>User Story</strong> I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

The following screenshot shows my App:
